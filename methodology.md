# Game Studio Starter Methodology

## Introduction

This document contains the starter methodology for the teams
of the inaugural game studio sequence at Ball State University.
Each team will take this methodology and adjust it to their
particular needs. There will be opportunities to update the
methodology during retrospective meetings.

## Definitions

We are one _studio_ with two _teams_. Students are _team members_. The professor may wear a few different hats: as a _mentor_, he can give you advice about how to proceed; as a _producer_, he will keep you on track; as an _instructor_, he will teach you new things, act as a liaison to the university, and be responsible for reporting grade and assessment data.

A _production day_ is any regular meeting day during which
no other activity has been scheduled. That is, every meeting 
day is a production day unless preempted by something else.

## Background and Values

The methodology is rooted in the values described in this section. Disagreement
about any of these values should be addressed with the instructor as soon as
possible.

We recognize and seek [the seven properties of Crystal
Clear](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/7-properties-of-highly-successful-projects-from-crystal-clear.php),
which are summarized below:
1. Frequent Delivery
2. Reflective Improvement
3. Osmotic Communication
4. Personal Safety
5. Focus
6. Easy Access to Expert Users
7. Technical Environment with Automated Tests, Configuration Management, and
   Frequent Integration

We uphold the value of safety through practices inspired by
[Anzeneering](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/anzeneering/).

We recognize that software is made by human beings and so we respect [the Heart of Agile](https://heartofagile.com).

We are proud to uphold the [BSU Beneficence Pledge](https://www.bsu.edu/about/beneficence).


## Rules

1. Each team member is expected to invest nine hours of attention per week on studio matters. 

1. The team owns the project. There are many kinds of work to be done, and any work can be done by any team member. You are authorized to contribute in any way to the project. Some people will tend to work on particular aspects of the game, but that is by choice, not by constraint.

    - We foster [T-shaped
      skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills), such that all team members share core competencies, and individual team members provide depth in particular areas.

    - This has the implication that all raw work assets must be stored in version control so that any team member can access them.

1. Use Slack for studio communication outside of scheduled meetings.
    - The #general and #random channels are available for studio-wide communication.
    - Other channels can be set up in an _ad hoc_ basis. Channels that are no longer needed should be archived.

1. We start each production day with a 9AM daily standup meeting, during which each member reports on the following to their team:
    - What did you contribute since last time?
    - What do you plan to accomplish before next time?
    - Are there any impediments?

1. If a team member is unable to attend a meeting or knows they will be late,
   they must post to the #general channel on Slack. This does not excuse the absence, but it does enable the rest of the team to move forward without uncertainty.


1. The _Treat Board_ is a schedule of when team members will be bringing treats for the studio. Team members may volunteer to bring treats at any time. A team member is obligated to sign up on the Treat Board in order to apologize for violations of the methodology. For example, missing or being late to a team meeting obligates a team member to sign up on the Treat Board.


1. The production plan will be managed using HacknPlan.
    - The design model should be disabled or not used.
    - User stories will be broken up into tasks.
    - Tasks will be estimated in clock hours.
    - Time spent on tasks will not be recorded.
    - At the end of every work session, the estimated time remaining on each task will be recorded.

1. Each production day starts with a "daily stand-up" meeting. Each team member will briefly answer these three questions:
    1. What did I contribute since last time?
    2. What do I plan to contribute before next time?
    3. What are my impediments?

1. The team's projection chart will be updated at the start of each production day.

1. The studio will have periodic Team Status Report and Retrospective meetings.
    - The Team Status Report meeting will be an opportunity for each team to formally present its status to the rest of the studio, as well as the producer and any stakeholders in attendance.
    - The Retrospective meeting will allow each team to make changes to its methodology.

1. Attention should always be paid to the highest priority work items.
    - Corollary: Solve the problems you have, not the problems you might have later. 
  
1. Keep a respectful volume level in order to respect the focus of your
   studiomates.

1. Keep the discussion in our shared spaces about the project. 
    - If you would like to talk about something unrelated, take it to the hallway
     or another location so as not to distract those who are focused on the project.
    - If there is something you'd like to discuss that *is* related to the project 
    but is not the topic at hand, record your comments and mention them at a more 
    appropriate time. Be firm in saying, "Hold up, let's maintain focus."

1. If a team member has a conflict with another team member, he or she should
   talk to that individual about it privately first, face-to-face. If a
   resolution is not met, the issue should be brought to the project mentor.

1. When faced with a design conflict (including software architecture,
   implementation details, user interface design, and game design) where two or
   more team members disagree, monitor the amount of time spent on the
   discussion. If a resolution is not found within five minutes, take one of the
   following options:
    - Invite the project mentor for a consultation.
    - Get a volunteer for each side. Schedule a follow-up meeting, with all
      relevant stakeholders, at which time each volunteer will be expected to
      demonstrate prototypes to describe their position. After this, the
      stakeholders vote on which direction to pursue.

1. Prefer working in [pairs](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html) or [mobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) so that knowledge is distributed among the team.

1. Follow [the GDQuest style guide for GDScript](https://gdquest.gitbook.io/gdquests-guidelines/godot-gdscript-guidelines).

1. Follow [Beams' best practices for commit messages in git](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

1. Any food brought to the studio during scheduled meetings is communal. 
   Bring what you like, but bring enough to share. 
    - Personal drinks are an exception: you do not have to pass your Mountain Dew around the room.
